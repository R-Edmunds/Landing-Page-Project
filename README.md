## About

This is my first dive into the world of JavaScript and DOM manipulation in the web browser. The dummy sections and nav bar links are generated programmatically on page load. There are also several listener events adding and removing element classes on-the-fly.

## Instructions

Open index.html in your favourite web browser, or visit https://getlegit.co.uk/udacity/landing/ for a live version.

## Plan

1. Add dummy links to navigation bar using js loop
1. Create a for loop to append N sections to the DOM
1. Create query that finds all section elements
1. Populate link list with section element links
1. Program viewport to scroll to section when respective link is clicked
1. Make above scrolling smooth
1. Make sections invisible by default
1. Program sections to appear when the heading is in top half of viewport
1. Use smooth fade-in for above
1. When in above visible state, add "active" ~~attribute~~ class to respective navigation link
1. Add distinct style for nav link active state

### Optional

- Hide navigation bar when user has not scrolled for a time
- Add "scroll to top" button when user is below the fold
- Further customise design and content
