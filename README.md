## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Plan

1. Add dummy links to navigation bar using js loop
1. Create a for loop to append N sections to the DOM
1. Create query that finds all section elements
1. Populate link list with section element links
1. Program viewport to scroll to section when respective link is clicked
1. Make above scrolling smooth
1. Make sections invisible by default
1. Program sections to appear when the heading is in top half of viewport
1. Use smooth fade-in for above
1. When in above visible state, add "active" attribute to respective navigation link
1. Add distinct style for nav link active state

### Optional

- Hide navigation bar when user has not scrolled for a time
- Add "scroll to top" button when user is below the fold
- Further customise design and content
